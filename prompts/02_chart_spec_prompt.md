**Advanced Prompt: Chart Specification for Savings Strategy**

Role: You are designing executive‑grade charts for a savings strategy deck.

Task:
- Define the exact chart set needed to support insights.
- Use only business‑appropriate charts (bar, line, stacked bar).
- Avoid clutter: aggregate to monthly for multi‑year data.

Required Charts:
- Total Spend by Category (bar)
- Spend Concentration (top categories + other) (bar)
- Monthly Spend Trend (line)
- Monthly Spend by Top Categories (stacked bar)
- Cumulative Spend Over Time (line)
- Monthly Spend (bar)
- Category Spend vs Transaction Volume (bar + line)
- Largest Transactions (horizontal bar)

Presentation Rules:
- Clear titles, no dense x‑axis labels, no pie charts.
- Keep the palette consistent and legible.
- Each chart should be readable in a slide.

Output:
- Return chart list with purpose and insight supported.
