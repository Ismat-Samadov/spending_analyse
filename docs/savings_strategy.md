**Savings Strategy Guide (Based on Jul 2022–Feb 2026 Spending)**
This guide turns the charts into a clear saving strategy. It focuses on the few decisions that move the total most, avoids noise, and keeps day‑to‑day life realistic.

**How to Use This Guide**
Read the sections in order. Each section maps to one or more charts and ends with a concrete rule or habit to carry forward.

---

**1) Start With the Biggest Categories**
Reference charts:
- `charts/total_spend_by_category.png`
- `charts/spend_concentration.png`

Why this matters: The top categories dominate the total. Changing them changes the outcome.

Strategy rules:
- Set clear caps for the top categories before adjusting anything else.
- Treat large, infrequent categories as planned events rather than routine spending.

---

**2) Control Spikes, Not Baseline**
Reference charts:
- `charts/monthly_spend_trend.png`
- `charts/monthly_spend_by_category_stacked.png`

Why this matters: The highest spikes come from one‑off charges, not daily habits. The budget jumps instead of drifting.

Strategy rules:
- Large one‑off expenses are reviewed before they land.
- Large expenses are spaced so they do not cluster in the same month.

---

**3) Timing Is a Lever**
Reference charts:
- `charts/cumulative_spend.png`
- `charts/monthly_spend.png`

Why this matters: Early large expenses lock in the curve and remove flexibility for the rest of the period.

Strategy rules:
- Schedule large expenses into a known window instead of letting them appear randomly.
- Keep early‑month spending tighter to protect flexibility later in the month.

---

**4) Focus on Value, Not Frequency**
Reference charts:
- `charts/category_spend_vs_frequency.png`

Why this matters: Some categories are frequent but not expensive. The real savings come from high‑value categories.

Strategy rules:
- High‑value categories stay the primary savings focus.
- High‑frequency categories are monitored for drift, not attacked by default.

---

**5) Review the Largest Transactions First**
Reference charts:
- `charts/largest_transactions.png`

Why this matters: A few transactions shape the entire outcome. Reviewing them yields fast wins.

Strategy rules:
- Create a simple threshold for review and stick to it.
- Separate large one‑off purchases from everyday categories in the plan.

**Practical Saving Framework**
This is the minimal, repeatable structure for consistent savings.

Step 1: Lock category caps
- Set caps on the top categories first.

Step 2: Plan the spikes
- List known large expenses and schedule them across the calendar.

Step 3: Protect early flexibility
- Keep early‑month spend tight to avoid locking in the curve.

Step 4: Watch for drift
- Track high‑frequency categories to catch slow increases.

Step 5: Review big items
- Use a review threshold so large items never land by surprise.

**Summary**
Savings come from a few high‑impact decisions, not from constant small cuts. The strategy is simple: focus on the biggest categories, prevent big spikes, and use timing as a lever to keep the budget flexible.
