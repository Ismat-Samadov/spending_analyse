**Savings Strategy Guide (Jul 2022–Feb 2026)**
This guide maps each chart directly to a concrete rule. The goal is a repeatable system — not willpower — built around the levers that actually move the total.

**How to Use This Guide**
Each section names the chart, explains what it reveals, and ends with a rule to carry forward. Rules are ordered by impact, not ease.

---

**1) Focus on Categories Above the Average Line**
Reference charts:
- `charts/total_spend_by_category.png`
- `charts/spend_concentration.png`

What the data shows: The average reference line on the category chart separates the high-impact categories from the long tail. The concentration chart confirms that the top categories collectively dominate the total, with each bar showing both the manat amount and the percentage share.

Strategy rules:
- Set caps only on categories that appear above the average line. Categories below it are not worth the attention.
- Treat large, infrequent categories (Health, Travel, Tech) as planned events with a pre-approved budget, not open-ended spending.
- Review the concentration chart quarterly to check whether the mix is shifting.

---

**2) Track Direction, Not Just Monthly Totals**
Reference charts:
- `charts/monthly_spend_trend.png`

What the data shows: The 3-month rolling average is the real signal. Individual monthly totals are too noisy to act on. The rolling average cuts through one-off spikes and shows whether the underlying trend is rising, stable, or falling. The peak month is annotated to show the worst-case scenario.

Strategy rules:
- Compare the rolling average to the 4-year baseline each month. If the rolling average has been above the baseline for three consecutive months, that is a structural shift — investigate which category is driving it.
- Do not react to a single high month unless it represents a pattern.

---

**3) Manage Seasons, Not Just Months**
Reference charts:
- `charts/monthly_spend_by_category_stacked.png`

What the data shows: Quarterly stacking makes seasonal category patterns visible. Some categories predictably expand in certain quarters. Knowing this in advance is more useful than being surprised by it.

Strategy rules:
- Identify the two quarters where total spend is typically highest. Tighten discretionary categories in those quarters specifically.
- If one category visibly grows its share of a quarter relative to prior years, that category becomes the priority for the following quarter.

---

**4) Set a Milestone Pace, Not Just an Annual Budget**
Reference charts:
- `charts/cumulative_spend.png`

What the data shows: The cumulative curve with milestone markers (25k AZN, 50k AZN, 75k AZN, 100k AZN) shows the pace of committed spend at any point in time. If the curve reaches a milestone ahead of schedule, the remaining months must compensate.

Strategy rules:
- At each milestone, pause and assess whether the pace is consistent with the annual target.
- If 50k AZN is reached before the end of July (month 6 of 12), the second half of the year needs to average less than the first half to stay on track.
- Schedule large known expenses to land after a milestone, not before — this prevents the curve from accelerating ahead of plan.

---

**5) Use YoY Growth as the Annual Health Check**
Reference charts:
- `charts/monthly_spend.png` (Annual YoY comparison)

What the data shows: Year-over-year totals with growth percentages embedded. This is the single clearest signal of whether spending is under control at the macro level.

Strategy rules:
- The annual spending target for each new year is set as the prior year's total plus an acceptable growth rate (e.g., no more than 5%).
- Any year where growth exceeds that threshold triggers a category-level review using the YoY heatmap.
- The current partial year is excluded from target-setting but is used to project the full-year trajectory.

---

**6) Distinguish Habit Categories from Decision Categories**
Reference charts:
- `charts/category_spend_vs_frequency.png`

What the data shows: The dual-axis chart separates categories by behavior type. The average transaction size embedded inside each bar is the key number. A high average + low transaction count = a decision to make each time. A low average + high transaction count = a habit to monitor for drift.

Strategy rules:
- Decision categories (Health, Tech, Travel, Communal): control the individual choice, not the frequency. Review before each transaction.
- Habit categories (Coffee, Market, Transport): do not try to reduce individual transactions. Monitor for upward drift in the monthly average. If the category's monthly total rises 15% above its prior-year average for two consecutive months, investigate.

---

**7) Set a Transaction Review Threshold**
Reference charts:
- `charts/largest_transactions.png`

What the data shows: The top 10 transactions across 44 months represent concentrated spend in a small number of decisions. These are the fastest savings opportunities because reviewing them requires minimal time and each yields the highest return.

Strategy rules:
- Identify the minimum value of the top 10 transactions. Use that as the review threshold.
- Any transaction at or above the threshold is reviewed before it is made, not after it appears in the statement.
- Discretionary transactions at or above the threshold require a 24-hour pause before proceeding.

---

**8) Cap the Weekend Premium**
Reference charts:
- `charts/day_of_week_spend.png`

What the data shows: Weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) have a higher average daily spend than weekdays. This premium is almost entirely discretionary — restaurants, leisure, unplanned purchases.

Strategy rules:
- Calculate the weekend premium (avg weekend daily spend minus avg weekday daily spend). That premium, multiplied by 104 (weekends per year), is the annual cost of weekend behavior.
- Set a weekend daily cap. Enforce it loosely — the goal is awareness, not restriction.
- If the gap between weekend and weekday spend is wider than expected, the primary source is likely Restaurant and Coffee on Saturdays and Sundays.

---

**9) Act on Habit Drift Before the Total Rises**
Reference charts:
- `charts/avg_transaction_trend.png`

What the data shows: The average transaction size per month, with a rolling average and a 4-year baseline. This is the early warning signal. When average transaction size rises, total spend will follow — even if frequency stays flat.

Strategy rules:
- If the 3-month rolling average of transaction size rises above the 4-year baseline for three consecutive months, identify which category is driving the increase.
- Inflation in essential categories (Market, Coffee) is expected and not actionable. Inflation in discretionary categories (Restaurant, Events) is a behavioral signal worth addressing.
- This chart is reviewed monthly, not quarterly. It is the fastest signal in the system.

---

**10) Prioritize the Heatmap Every Year**
Reference charts:
- `charts/category_yoy_growth.png`

What the data shows: Year-over-year percentage change for the top 8 categories. Red cells indicate categories where spend rose relative to the prior year. Green cells indicate categories where spend fell or held flat.

Strategy rules:
- At the start of each year, identify the reddest cells from the prior year. Those categories receive caps first.
- Categories that are consistently green are left alone — they are already under control.
- A category that moves from green to red is the highest priority signal. It means a behavioral shift occurred, not just a bad month.
- The heatmap is generated fresh each time new data is added. It should be the first chart reviewed in any annual planning session.

**Practical Saving Framework**
This is the minimal repeatable structure for consistent savings.

Step 1: Set category caps (monthly)
- Apply caps only to categories above the average line on the spend-by-category chart.

Step 2: Monitor the rolling average (monthly)
- If the 3-month rolling average exceeds the 4-year baseline for three months, investigate.

Step 3: Check milestone pace (quarterly)
- If cumulative spend reaches a milestone ahead of schedule, tighten the following quarter.

Step 4: Run the YoY review (annually)
- Use the heatmap to identify which categories need caps for the upcoming year.
- Set the annual target as prior year + acceptable growth rate.

Step 5: Watch habit drift (monthly)
- Track the avg transaction trend. Act before the total spend chart reflects the problem.

Step 6: Review large transactions (ongoing)
- Any transaction at or above the threshold is reviewed before it is made.

**Summary**
The system has six inputs: category caps, rolling average direction, cumulative pace, YoY heatmap, habit drift signal, and large transaction review. Each input maps to a specific chart. Running all six takes under 30 minutes per month. The savings come from consistency, not intensity.
